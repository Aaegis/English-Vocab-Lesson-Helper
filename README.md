# English-Vocab-Lesson-Helper
This is a program made for my friends, classmates, or really anyone, as well as myself. 

My English teacher, Mr. Madden, every once in a while publishes tests whicih require his students to memorize 30 different vocabulary words.
This website will help with that memorization.

What the website does:
It contains a button that when pressed, will output the current vocabulary words (must be manually updated) in a random order. This text can be copied and pasted
into a text editor such as Google Docs, Notepad, Notepad++, etc.

The website contains code from one of coolaj86's posts on StackOverflow.
